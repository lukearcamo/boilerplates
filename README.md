### Boilerplates

Useful coding templates for various situations:
- A basic blank HTML page (I use this for testing out CSS stuff)
- An HTML page with an animated 2D canvas
- A simple Three.js 3D scene viewed from an orbiting camera
- A 2d screen shader which renders a quad using Three.js (create shaders in a similar environment to https://www.shadertoy.com/, but here since you can do stuff outside of just the shader e.g. hook up a raytracer's ray origin & direction to an invisible virtual Three.js camera's transformations using custom uniforms)
- An OpenGL C++ workspace using GLFW and GLAD
